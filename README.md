# Peking University/Baidu - Autonomous Driving Kaggle Competition Solution
This repository contains the code for the final project of the Intermediate Machine Learning Course from Opencampus

## Problem Description
Develop a model to estimate the absolute pose of vehicles from a single image in a real-world traffic environment.

The final project is based on the "Peking University/Baidu - Autonomous Driving" Kaggle competition linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pku-autonomous-driving/overview
